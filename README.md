# cpptree - An Extensible C++ Library for Decision Trees

This repository contains a pre-alpha version of a cpptree - a C++ library for decision trees.

The source code is based on the C++ 11 standard and has no dependencies except for the C++ Standard Library.
A modular software design allows for an implementation of a large variety of decision tree algorithms via simple software extensions.
The library is written in C++ to achieve a high degree of computational performance, while allowing for object-oriented programming and portability to other programming languages, e.g., Java, R or Python.

The library is sufficiently equipped to create a standalone C++ application.
The R folder contains an R package that exposes the entire library functionality to R.
